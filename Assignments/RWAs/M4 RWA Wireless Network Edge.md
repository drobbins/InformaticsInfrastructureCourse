## Outcomes
After successfully completing this assignment, you will be able to:

1. Discover the wireless use of network at your place of business or a nearby school or business by various kinds of computing devices and from various locations on and off the property. (SLO 2)
3. Write professional reports analyzing information technology functions. (SLO 1)

## Instructions

In this assignment, you will complete one of four tasks on wireless networking and produce a report documenting your work. The list of tasks to choose from is listed below and is followed by the outline for the report. Remember to only do one of the tasks.

1. Select a task from the List of Tasks.
2. Complete the task as listed.
3. Prepare a report on the task, following the instructions in Outline for the Report
4. Name your file JonesM4-1.ppt (or .pptx), where "Jones" is your last name and "1" is the RWA number. Submit the file to the appropriate Real World Assignment.

In addition to completing the above instructions:

* Edit this page as you find additional information that you feel may be useful to future students.
* Feel free to add guidance to the instructions, insofar as you do not modify the basic requirements.

### List of Tasks

*   **Wireless Connection Outside the Border of the Business.** On all four sides **outside** of the business' border, find out how far the wireless signal reaches such that a satisfactory connection can be made. Measure the distance approximately in yards from the fence/border and give specific descriptions of the locations where the data values were gathered. Do this for at least all eight major compass directions.
*   **Continuous Audio Play Outdoors on the Business Property.** From within the border of the business property, start outdoors at one side of the border and start a streaming audio connection. Walk directly across to the other side of the property, going in/through/around buildings. While doing so, monitor the quality and connectivity of the wireless stream. Do this when traversing the property for at least all eight major compass directions.
*   **Wireless Dead Spots on the Business Property.** Find one or more wireless dead spots both indoors and outdoors within the border of the business where a wireless connection cannot be established. Use a systematic approach to finding the deadspots. One idea for getting started is to ask a sample of workers at the business if they know of any dead spots.
*   **Variety of Wireless Devices.** Survey people who are currently using a wireless device to access the network. Find out the brand name of the device, the model of the device, and what the specific purpose is of the current wireless connection (e.g., checking e-mail). Ask enough people so you have information on at least **four** different brands and **ten** different models of devices. Do not include cell phones that are using a network connection other than the main wireless network for the business.

### Outline for the Report

Your report shall be in the form of a PowerPoint slide set. Use a separate slide (or set of slides) for each section below in your report. Place the section name at the top of the first slide of that section. Keep your file size to 20 slides or less.

1.  Statement of the Task:
    *   State the task you are performing
    *   Include any preliminary observations or background information about the task
2.  Hypothesis:
    *   Write what you think the findings of this task will show
3.  Procedure:
    *   Describe the steps you followed to complete the task
    *   Your steps should be written so that anyone else could repeat the task
4.  Results (Data):
    *   Include any data tables and notes of your observations
    *   If applicable, include such items as diagrams, maps, or photographs
    *   Label all items
5.  Conclusion:

    *   Accept or reject your hypothesis and explain why you did so using data from your findings
    *   Include a summary of the data - averages, highest value, lowest value, etc, to help the reader understand your results
    *   List at least one thing you learned from doing this task
