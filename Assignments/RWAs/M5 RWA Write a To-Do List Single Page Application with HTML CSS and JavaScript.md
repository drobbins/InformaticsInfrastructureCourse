## Outcomes
After successfully completing this assignment, you will be able to:

1. Write a single page application using HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript. (SLO 2)

## Instructions

A single-page-application is a small web app that is contained entirely on one page. In the smallest examples, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript used are all contained in one small file. This file is downloaded and executed in a web browser, providing the smallest example of what we now call Web 2.0.

In this exercise you'll create a single page application that provides a to-do list application.

1. Write a single page application that provides a to-do list. At minimum, your application should provide users the ability to:
    - Create to-do items.
    - View a list of their to-do items.
    - Mark to-do items as "done".
    - Delete unwanted to-do items.
1. Your application should also follow these constraints:
    - You may use external libraries if you want, but you are encouraged to refrain from doing so.
    - All of your HTML, JavaScript, and CSS should be included in one file.
    - Be sure to structure your code in a way that is easy to read and understand.
1. Submit your single page application file to complete this assignment.

In addition to completing the above instructions:

* Edit this page as you find additional information that you feel may be useful to future students.
* Feel free to add guidance to the instructions, insofar as you do not modify the basic requirements.
