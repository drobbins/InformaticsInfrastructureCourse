## Outcomes
After successfully completing this assignment, you will be able to:

1. Discuss the available configurations of servers from traditional and cloud vendors, identifying appropriate health care applications based on these configurations. (SLO 2)

## Instructions

1. Select a vendor of either virtual or physical servers (see [Possible Vendors](#possiblevendors))
2. Identify the server configurations available from that vendor.
    * Pay attention to compute power, storage capacity, memory, special features (e.g. GPUs), costs, and cost structure (e.g. per unit time, or a one time purchase).
    * If many options are available from your selected vendor, pay attention to the _classes_ of servers (i.e. those with similar overall configurations).
3. Prepare a brief report:
    * Identify the vendor.
    * List and describe the server classes offered, with at least one example of each.
    * What applications are most appropriate for each of the identified classes of server? What health care applications would likely best fit each class of server?
5. Submit your report to the appropriate Real World Assignment.

In addition to completing the above instructions:
