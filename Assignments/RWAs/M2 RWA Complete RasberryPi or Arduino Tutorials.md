## Outcomes
After successfully completing this assignment, you will be able to:

1. Build and configure low cost computers using pre-packaged components and publicly available instructions. (SLO 2, 3)
2. Identify and Discuss the instances in your kit of standard computational elements, including computing, storage, and input/output. (SLO 1)
3. Propose potential health care applications in your field of the device(s) you worked with. (SLO 1)

## Instructions

1. Select and purchase, or otherwise obtain the use of, a low-cost computing kit (see [Possible Kits](#possiblekits))
2. Complete the initial "getting started" tutorials provided with your device.
3. Select and complete a more advanced tutorial, either from those included with your device (if any) or from those available on the web.
    * Reach out to your instructor if you need assistance in finding a tutorial.
4. Prepare a brief report:
    * The device you selected and the kit used.
    * List and describe the function of the major components of your device.
    * What project or tutorial did you complete? What was the end result? Were you successful?
    * If possible, prepare a video showing your device and the completed project.
    * Discuss potential health care applications of your device, or similar devices.
5. Submit your report and video to the appropriate Real World Assignment.

In addition to completing the above instructions:

* Edit this page as you find additional information that you feel may be useful to future students.
* Feel free to add guidance to the instructions, insofar as you do not modify the basic requirements.

### Possible Kits
* [Arduino Starter Kit](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-starter-kit) - electronics and Internet-of-Things focus.
* [RasberryPi Kit](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus-starter-kit.html) - low-cost computing focus.
    * [A List of Kits](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3244253/computers/best-raspberry-pi-kits.html). Some of these kits require additional purchases of connectors and/or the RasberryPi itself.
