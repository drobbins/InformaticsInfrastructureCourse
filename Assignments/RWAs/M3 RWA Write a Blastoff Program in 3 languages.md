    * Describe the languages selected and what drew you to them.
    * Include a copy of your source code for each of the three _Blastoff!_ programs.
        * You may include links to online versions if you used an online environment.
    * Discuss your learning, as well as any challenges you faced in completing the assignment.
1. Submit your report to the appropriate Real World Assignment.

In addition to completing the above instructions:

* Edit this page as you find additional information that you feel may be useful to future students.
* Feel free to add guidance to the instructions, insofar as you do not modify the basic requirements.

### Tips

* A good place to start might be to find a "hello world" program in your selected language. This will show you how to print things.
* Another good place to start may be searching for "\<language\> tutorial". Some possible options are included below.
