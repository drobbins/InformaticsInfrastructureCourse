## Outcomes
After successfully completing this assignment, you will be able to:

1. Write a simple program in three different languages. (SLO 2)
3. Identify useful online resources for learning programming languages. (SLO 3)

## Instructions

The _FizzBuzz_ test is a common interview question designed to filter out programming job candidates who can't seem to actually program. The assignment is simple:

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

For this assignment, you'll ace this problem.

1. Do _not_ look for _FizzBuzz_ solutions online.
2. Write a _FizzBuzz_ program in three programming languages.
    * Your programs should follow the assignment as quoted above.
    * Your programs should make use of (at least):
        * A loop
        * Variables
        * Conditional statements
3. Prepare a brief report:
    * Describe the languages selected and what drew you to them.
    * Include a copy of your source code for each of the three _FizzBuzz_ programs.
        * You may include links to online versions if you used an online environment.
    * Discuss your learning, as well as any challenges you faced in completing the assignment.
4. Submit your report to the appropriate Real World Assignment.

In addition to completing the above instructions:

* Edit this page as you find additional information that you feel may be useful to future students.
* Feel free to add guidance to the instructions, insofar as you do not modify the basic requirements.

### Tips

* A good place to start might be to find a "hello world" program in your selected language. This will show you how to print things.
* Another good place to start may be searching for "\<language\> tutorial". Some possible options are included below.
