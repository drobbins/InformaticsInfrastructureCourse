## Outcomes
After successfully completing this assignment, you will be able to:

1. Install an open-source electronic health record. (SLO 2)
3. Identify and follow online instructions for configuring EHRs. (SLO 3)

## Instructions

This is one of the most RW of all our RWAs - installing an electronic health record is without question a task for health informatics practitioners.

1. Browse [OpenEMR](https://www.open-emr.org) for installation instructions.
    * You may select a different EMR from the list below if desired, but it may be more difficult to install.
    * *Hint:* follow the link for Docs to begin.
1. Follow the instructions to set up and configure OpenEMR.
    * Since this is a demonstration server, rather than one that will be used in actual practice, you may optionally skip "securing" or "hardening" the service.
1. Prepare a brief report:
    * Did you use the recommended EMR, or select another one?
    * Which set of installation instructions did you use? Provide a link.
    * Were you able to follow the instructions exactly as written, or did you find yourself needing to look at additional resources? If so, which ones? Were there errors in the installation instructions?
    * What challenges did you encounter along the way? How did you overcome them?
1. Submit your report to the assignment.
    * Optional: Demo your open EMR installation. This can be done with an in-person meeting or web teleconference with your instructor, or by sending your instructor a link to your EMR if it is accessible online.

In addition to completing the above instructions:

* Edit this page as you find additional information that you feel may be useful to future students.
* Feel free to add guidance to the instructions, insofar as you do not modify the basic requirements.
