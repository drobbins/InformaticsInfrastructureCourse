## Outcomes
After successfully completing this assignment, you will be able to:

1. Interact with HTTP and HTTPs web servers using command line tools. (SLO 2)
3. Use underspecified instructions from common technical websites to complete informatics tasks. (SLO 3)

## Instructions

Stack Overflow is a very commonly used technical question-and-answer website used by computing professionals to find example solutions they can tailor to accomplish their goals. In this RWA you'll begin with a question answered on Stack Overflow, and from there branch out to other resources as necessary as you learn to interact with web servers using HTTP requests directly from the command line.

1. Review this Stack Overflow question: [How to send an HTTP request using Telnet](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15772355/how-to-send-an-http-request-using-telnet)
1. Using the answers to this question as a basis, use an a command line tool (telnet or openssl) to send requests and receive responses from a website.
    - Try multiple websites, and see which provide the most sensible responses when viewed as text.
1. Prepare a brief report:
    - Describe the sites you loaded briefly. Which were the most friendly?
    - List and briefly describe your use of other web resources besides the initial Stack Overflow question. How did you find them?
    - Include a copy of your command line session transcript, showing the commands typed and the responses they generated.
    - Discuss your learning, as well as any challenges you faced in completing the assignment.
1. Submit a transcript of your command line session and your report to the assignment.

In addition to completing the above instructions:

* Edit this page as you find additional information that you feel may be useful to future students.
* Feel free to add guidance to the instructions, insofar as you do not modify the basic requirements.
