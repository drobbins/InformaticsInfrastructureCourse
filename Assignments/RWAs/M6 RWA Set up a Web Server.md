## Outcomes
After successfully completing this assignment, you will be able to:

1. Configure a basic web server using cloud services. (SLO 2)
3. Identify and follow online instructions for configuring cloud services. (SLO 3)

## Instructions

Digital Ocean is one of many low-cost cloud server providers. In this assignment you'll set up a basic web server in Digital Ocean's cloud, using their excellent documentation and tutorials.

While larger scale cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google's Cloud Platform are more commonly used in large-scale deployments, their complexity makes Digital Ocean a better starting place. However, the skills learned configuring servers at Digital Ocean will readily translate to these larger providers.

1. Find an appropriate tutorial at [Digital Ocean's ](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials).
    * Recommendation: look for a tutorial for installing the web server Nginx on the operating system Ubuntu.
1. Complete [CSS Tutorials at W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
    - Begin with the "CSS HOME" section, and work through the "CSS Tables" section.
1. Write (or modify an existing) webpage (HTML file) using CSS and HTML.
    * Provide a url to your web page on your web server.
    * Which tutorial did you use? Provide a link.
    * Did you modify the web page on the server, or upload your own? How did you accomplish this?
    * What challenges did you encounter along the way? How did you overcome them?
1. Submit your webpage to the assignment.

In addition to completing the above instructions:

* Edit this page as you find additional information that you feel may be useful to future students.
* Feel free to add guidance to the instructions, insofar as you do not modify the basic requirements.
