Semester Learning Goals & Strategy
==================================
## Purpose
An excellent way to initiate a learning process, such as a course, is to reflect briefly on your intention to learn. What do you want to learn? What interests you about this course, if anything? Envisioning yourself at the end of the course, what concrete skills, new knowledge, and changed perspectives would you like to possess?

After capturing your goals for the course, a natural next step is to reflect on the strategies you'll use to accomplish them. How will you approach the course work? What will guide your focus on content and selection of optional assignments?

Keep in mind that neither your goals nor your strategies are set in stone. What you're creating here is a first draft of your plan - this plan can be revised and evolved liberally throughout the semester (in subsequent journal entries).
