### Course Description

Broadly defined, the practice of informatics centers on the capture, storage, retrieval, and use of information. These processes typically also involve the management of data, the raw facts, underlying the information. As such, it should come as no surprise that information technology, or IT, provides the infrastructure for informatics. In this course we'll survey the breadth of information technologies. Our ultimate objective is to become conversant in the state-of-the-art and develop a know-how-it-works mindset towards IT.


### Course Delivery Description
This course is a web-based course delivered online (asynchronous) via [Canvas](https://samford.instructure.com/). All assignments will be submitted via [Canvas](https://samford.instructure.com/).


### Course Prerequisites
None


### Required Course Materials

Readings will be uploaded to [Canvas](https://samford.instructure.com/).


### Technology Requirements
Technology is an essential and integral aspect of an online course. The student must have access to a computer and stable connection to the Internet on a regular basis. A high-speed internet connection, such as a cable modem or DSL line is preferred. The student will need access to standard office software including Word, PowerPoint, and an Excel. As web-enhanced/online lectures contain an audio component, the student will additionally need the capability to access audio through speakers. This course is completely online. Samford utilizes the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS). Canvas is best accessed using the most recent versions of Chrome or Firefox web browsers.

Microsoft Office 365 is available for free download to all current faculty, staff, and students. This can be easily downloaded from the [Technology Services website](https://www.samford.edu/departments/technology-services/). You will need to sign in with your Samford User Name and Password to download and use this software.

It is expected all written assignments be completed with Microsoft Word since Microsoft Office 365 has been provided to all members of Samford University. If the student uses another word processing application, require them to convert their document into a PDF prior to it being uploaded to Canvas.

[Technology Services](https://www.samford.edu/departments/technology-services/) offers telephone, email, and in-person support to all Samford student and employees. Technology Services is located in the lower level of University Library, Room 012. Hours of operation are listed below.

**Hours of Operation**
In person: [University Library](https://www.samford.edu/campus-map/?university-library), Room 012, Monday-Friday, 7 a.m.-5 p.m.

Technology can be problematic. Internet connections can be slow or down; computers may malfunction; power outages can cause delays or the inability to connect. Technological issues are not acceptable excuses for late assignments. **Be prepared and have a backup plan.**



### Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)
At the completion of this course, the student will be able to:

- **SLO 1** - Discuss information technology (IT) from a systems-thinking perspective, including hardware, software, and integrated systems. <br/>AMIA Alignment: F2-Knowledge
- **SLO 2** - Implement and use IT solutions in a variety of contexts. <br/>AMIA Alignment: F4-Skills
- **SLO 3** - Develop effective strategies for extending their detailed knowledge to encompass new information technologies. <br/>AMIA Alignment: F8-Attitudes/Abilities

SLOs for this course are aligned with [AMIA 2017 Competencies for Health Informatics Education at the Master’s Degree Level](https://www.amia.org/sites/default/files/AMIA-Health-Informatics-Core-Competencies-for-CAHIIM.PDF). Alignments are indicated by {Foundational Domain}-{Competency}. For example, F2-Knowledge indicates the Knowledge competency of foundational area 2 (Information Science and Technology).


### Instructional Method and Learning Strategies
The course is delivered asynchronously online. The course is organized in Units and Modules, which should be completed by the dates given in the **Course Schedule**. Instruction will be provided through web-based lectures in Canvas, web-based tutorials, readings, discussions, and recall-practice quizzes.

#### Recall Practice Questions & Quizzes _SLO 1, 3_
One of the best ways to remember what you're studying is to self-quiz. As you read, watch, listen, and otherwise learn, create a few multiple-choice style questions. These will be posted to a discussion forum so your colleagues can benefit, and then 5-7 select questions will be used during the later week(s) of the module as assigned quizzes.

#### Real World Assignments _SLOs 2, 3_
During each module, you will select and complete one or more Real World Assignments from a menu provided by your instructor. Each of these assignments represents an opportunity to practice an IT skill related to that modules content. Beyond building your toolbox of relevant skills, these assignments also allow you to practice finding solutions to IT problems online.

#### In The Wild Analyses and Discussion _SLOs 1, 3_
During the second and third week of each module, you will select and analyze a news story or IT system related to the modules content, with on a systems-thinking perspective. You will also read and discuss your colleagues analyses, offering feedback and contributing your discipline-specific insights.

#### Learning Journals _SLO 3_
At the beginning and end of each module, as well as after completing major assignments, you'll complete a learning journal reflecting on your goals, strategies, and accomplishments


### Course Outline / Schedule
The course schedule, which provides Unit/Module completion and assignment due dates is located in Canvas.


### Course Activities, Assessments, and Interactions
This class is taught during a 15-week semester. For every hour of a class, an average of 3-4 hours of preparation and reading (not including assignments) would be considered normal. Web-based classes require as much, if not more, preparation on the part of the student as face-to-face classes.

This course consists of a sequence of activities, assessments, and interactions to support you in achieving the Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs) for this course. You will engage in activities, discussions, online-labs, and periodic submission of graded assignments which will provide feedback to enhance learning. Required activities are detailed in each Unit/Module. Instructions, examples, and a grading rubric for each assignment are located in their individual folders in Canvas.


### Grading
Grades are assigned using weighted categories, as outlined below.

| Activity                            | % Total |

#### Academic Integrity
Students, upon enrollment, enter into voluntary association with Samford University. They must be willing to observe high standards of intellectual integrity; they must respect knowledge and practice academic honesty. Those who cheat on an examination or class assignment are not only academically dishonest, but also completely deficient in the scholarly maturity necessary for college study.

Any act to obtain an unfair academic advantage is considered dishonest.  An academic integrity violation is defined as the act of lying, cheating or stealing academic information to gain academic advantage for oneself or another.  Students who commit academic integrity violations will be charged as such and will be subject to the consequences of the violation as deemed by the faculty.
