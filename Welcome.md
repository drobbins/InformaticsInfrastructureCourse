**Course Description:** Broadly defined, the practice of informatics centers on the capture, storage, retrieval, and use of information. These processes typically also involve the management of data, the raw facts, underlying the information. As such, it should come as no surprise that information technology, or IT, provides the infrastructure for informatics. In this course we'll survey the breadth of information technologies. Our ultimate objective is to become conversant in the state-of-the-art and develop a know-how-it-works mindset towards IT.
